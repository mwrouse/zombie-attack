# Zombie Attack!
This is my first HTML/Javascript game.

It is a recreation of a game that I created while in high school in QBasic. 

It uitilizes my [jQuery Require Once](https://github.com/mwrouse/jquery-require-once) script.


## Controls
The controls for the game are simple:
ESC - Pause
W/Up - Move upwards
A/Left - Move left
S/Down - Move downwards
D/Right - Move right
SPACE - Attack
